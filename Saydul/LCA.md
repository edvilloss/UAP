- Marine Eutriphication
	- Marine eutrophication is a response of the marine ecosystem to the increased availability of a limiting nutrient, primarily nitrogen (N), in the euphotic zone of marine waters. This increased availability of nutrients, particularly nitrogen, leads to an enhancement of primary production, which can have negative impacts on the ecosystem, such as increased growth of phytoplankton, reduced water quality, and hypoxia [](https://www.lc-impact.eu/doc/method/Chapter9_Marine%20Eutrophication_20190207.pdf)
	- In Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), "kg N eq" is an abbreviation for "kilogram nitrogen equivalent." It is an indicator used to measure the environmental impact of nitrogen emissions on ecosystems, particularly in terms of eutrophication. This indicator is used to quantify the enrichment of marine ecosystems with nutritional elements due to the emission of nitrogen-containing compounds[](https://ecochain.com/blog/impact-categories-lca/)
- Terrestrial ecotoxicity
	- Terrestrial ecotoxicity refers to the study of how environmental pollutants affect land-dependent organisms and their environment. It involves understanding the sources, receptors, and exposure pathways of pollutants in terrestrial ecosystems, including soil, plants, and animals. The assessment of terrestrial ecotoxicity is crucial for evaluating the potential harm caused by pollutants to non-target organisms and ecosystems, and for developing strategies to mitigate these impacts[](https://noack-lab.com/study-services/terrestrial-ecotoxicity/)[](https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NHEERL&dirEntryId=103963)[](https://lc-impact.eu/EQterrestrial_ecotoxicity.html).
	- In the context of terrestrial ecotoxicity, "kg 1.4-DCB" is a unit of measurement used to express the environmental impact of pollutants on land-dependent organisms and ecosystems. It is a reference unit, equivalent to the toxicity of 1 kilogram of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB), which is a chemical compound commonly used as a pesticide and herbicide[](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/documents/downloadPublic?appId=PPGMS&documentIds=080166e5ca61c56a)[](https://noack-lab.com/study-services/terrestrial-ecotoxicity/)[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7327801/).
		- This unit is used to quantify the ecotoxicity of various substances, including pesticides, herbicides, and other chemicals, by comparing their toxicity to that of 1,4-DCB. The ecotoxicity of a substance is calculated based on its potential to harm non-target organisms, such as beneficial insects, plants, and microorganisms, in the terrestrial environment[](https://noack-lab.com/study-services/terrestrial-ecotoxicity/)[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7327801/)
- Freshwater ecotoxicity 
	- Is an environmental impact category in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) that measures the potential toxic effects of chemicals on freshwater ecosystems[](https://www.teknoscienze.com/freshwater-ecotoxicity-as-an-impact-category-in-life-cycle-assessment/)[](https://fhburgenland.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/p15425dc/id/115383/download)[](https://lc-impact.eu/EQfreshwater_ecotoxicity.html).Â It quantifies the impact of chemical emissions on aquatic organisms, leading to biodiversity loss and species extinction[](https://fhburgenland.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/p15425dc/id/115383/download).The Freshwater Aquatic Ecotoxicity Potential (FAETP) is used to express the ecotoxicity of chemicals in freshwater, with characterization factors measured in kg 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) equivalent[](https://fhburgenland.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/api/collection/p15425dc/id/115383/download)[](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28082057/).
- Marine ecotoxicity
	- refers to the potential harm caused by chemicals to marine ecosystems, including the impacts on aquatic organisms and their habitats.[](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-023-02277-4)[](https://lc-impact.eu/EQmarine_ecotoxicity.html)[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7372721/).
- Human carcinogenic toxicity
	- refers to the potential harm caused by chemicals to human health through carcinogenic effects.
	- In ecotoxicity assessments, 1,4-DCB is used as a reference substance due to its well-documented toxicity and environmental fate. The characterization factors for ecotoxicity are typically expressed in terms of the toxicity of 1,4-DCB, which is considered a standard unit of measurement. A negative value of 1,4-DCB equivalent indicates that the substance has a lower ecotoxicity potential compared to 1,4-DCB, making it a more environmentally friendly option[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/1-4-dichlorobenzene)[](https://datasheets.scbt.com/sc-237757.pdf)[](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/1-4-dichlorobenzene).
