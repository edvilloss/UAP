# Earthquake
Another evidence in favor of the theory is the existence of fault lines on the surface of the earth, which also seem to support the notion of ==**Continental Drift**== (Wegner 1912) that hypothesizes the drift of earth masses over millions of years. 
## Earthquake Terminology 
The point beneath the earth’s surface where the rocks break and move is called the focus of the earthquake. The *focus* is the underground point of origin of an earthquake.

Directly above the focus, on earth’s surface, is the epicenter. Earthquake waves reach the epicenter first. During an earthquake, the most violent shaking is found at the *epicenter*.
# Seismic waves
During earthquakes, the strain energy stored within the crustal plates is released through ‘seismic waves’. Seismic waves can be divided into two groups based on passage through Earth's body.
- Body Wave: Waves that travel **inside the Earth's interior**. According to the wave property these waves can be divided into the following two classes
	- P-waves (primary wave, ==**longitudinal**== or pressure wave): They are similar to sound waves. The particles vibrate along or **parallel to the direction of wave propagation**. These are the fastest waves.
	- S-waves (shear wave, secondary wave, or **==transverse==** wave): The particles vibrate ==**perpendicular to the direction of the wave propagation**==. The vibration shakes horizontally and the velocity of the S-waves is next to that of the P-waves as they pass through the same medium.
- Surface Waves: Waves that travel ==along the Earth's surface== and the layers near the surface. These waves can generally be divided into the following two classes:
	- Rayleigh waves: The particles vibrate on ==a vertical plane== and follow a retrograde ellipse.
	- Love waves: The particles vibrate on a ==horizontal plane and perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation==

# Earthquake Magnitude
Magnitude is a number that characterizes the relative size of an earthquake. It is based on measurement of the maximum motion recorded by a ==Seismograph==.
## Richter Scale ($M_{L}$)
Charles F. Richter (1935) introduced the concept of earthquake magnitude. His original definition was, $$M_{L}=\log\left( \frac{A}{A_{0}} \right)$$
$A$ = Maximum trace amplitude in micrometers 
$A_{0}$ = Amplitude of the smallest detectable wave (or standard wave)
Readings from all observing stations are averaged after adjustment with station-specific corrections to obtain ML
## Body-Wave Magnitude ($m_{b}$)
Formula 
$$
m_{b}=\log_{10}\left( \frac{A}{T} \right)+Q(D,h)

$$
A = amplitude of ground motion ( in microns)
T = corresponding period ( seconds )
Q(D,h) = correction factor that is a function of distance, D(degrees), between epicenter and station and focal depth, h(in km), of the EQ.

## Surface-Wave Magnitude ($M_{S}$)
Formula
$$
M_{S}=\log_{10}\left( \frac{A}{T} \right)+1.66\log_{10}D+3.33
$$

## Moment Magnitude ($M_{w}$)
The various magnitude scales (ML, mb, Ms) underestimate the energy released in case of large earthquakes. Seismologists lave developed a standard magnitude scale known a moment magnitude, that is calculated using the moment (M0) developed during earthquake fault rupture. It depends on physical dimensions of rupture
(area A), shear modulus of rock (G) and average displacement (d) of fault plane.

A couple of shear forces acting on either side of the fault act a distance ‘b’ apart, producing a moment 
$$
M_{0}=Fb
$$
If ‘d’ is the displacement, the shear strain ($\gamma$) developed by the couple = d/b
$\therefore$ Shear stress ($\tau) =G*Shear strain (\gamma)=G*\left( \frac{d}{b} \right)$
$\therefore The shear forece F = Shear stress (\tau)*Area(A)=G\left( \frac{d}{b} \right)A$
$$
M_{0}=Fb=\left[ G\left( \frac{d}{b} \right)A \right]b=GAd
$$
The moment magnitude can be computed as
$$
M_{w}=\frac{\log(M_{0})}{1.5}-10.7 (M_{0} in dyne-cm)

$$
$$
M_{w}=\frac{\log(M_{0})}{1.5}-4 (M_{0} in kN-m)
$$
