# Mechanics
- ,Mechanics is the branch of science concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment.
- Based on the concepts: time, space, force, energy, matter. 
- The mechanics, which is developed as on today, may be grouped as below:
	- Classical (Newtonian) mechanics
	- (The mechanics based on Newton’s laws of motion) Relativistic mechanics
	- Quantum or wave mechanics
# Engineering Mechanics
- Engineering /Applied mechanics is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics. Applied mechanics examines the response of bodies (solids and fluids) or systems of bodies to external forces. 
- Some examples of mechanical systems include the flow of   a liquid under pressure, the fracture of a solid from an applied force, or the vibration of an ear in response to sound.
- Classification of Engineering Mechanics
	- Mechanics of Rigid Bodies
		- A body in which all the particles occupy the fixed position with respect to each other is called body of rigid body. However no body is rigid; everybody undergoes some deformation which acted by forces.
		- ![[Assets/Attachments/Diagram.svg]]
	- Mechanics of Deform-able Bodies
	- Mechanics of Fluids
- The mechanics of rigid bodies dealing with bodies with rest is termed as ‘Statics’ and that dealing with the bodies in motion is termed as ‘Dynamics’ The dynamics is further divided into two streams – Kinematics and kinetics.
	- ‘Kinematics’ is the branch of dynamics which deals with the motion of bodies without referring to the forces causing the motion of the body.
	- ‘Kinetics’ is the branch of dynamics which deals with the motion of bodies referring to the forces causing the motion

# Force
- Force may be defined as an agent which produces, destroy or tends to destroy motion.
- Definition of force: a force should be completely defined only when the following four characteristics are specified.
	- Magnitude
	- Line of action/location
	- Direction/sense
	- Point of application
- Types of forces:
	- Fundamental Forces:
		- Electromagnetic Force 
		- Gravitational Force 
		- Strong Nuclear Force 
		- Weak Nuclear Force
	- Non-fundamental forces (Acting on a body):
		- Push or Pull
		- Tension or Compression
		- Weight
		- Friction and Normal force
		- Shear Force

# Resultant and Components Force
- Resultant and components Force
	- If a number of forces P1, P2, P3 ……. etc are acting simultaneously on a particle, then a single force, which will produce the same effect as that of all the given forces, is known as a resultant force. The forces P1, P2, P3 ……etc are called component forces.
## Parallelogram Law of Forces

## Rectangular component/ orthogonal component

# Co-planer concurrent forces
- If the forces in a system lie in a single plane and pass through a single point, then the system constitutes a coplanar concurrent force system
- Resultant
	- $R_{x}=\sum F_{x}$
	- $R_{y}=\sum F_{y}$
	- $R=\sqrt{ R_{x}^2 +R_{y}^2}$
	- $\tan \theta =\frac{\left( \sum F_{y} \right)}{\left( \sum F_{x} \right)}$
- Equilibrium Conditions
	- $R_{x}=0;R_{y}=0$
- Equilibrium of 3 forces
	- Triangle law of forces
		- If two forces acting simultaneously on a body are represented by the sides of a triangle taken in order, their resultant is represented by the closing side of the triangle taken in the opposite side
		- ![[Pasted image 20240609213446.png]]
		- $P+Q=R$
	- Lami's Theorem
		- Lami's theorem is an equation relating the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keeps an object in static equilibrium, with the angles directly opposite to the corresponding forces. P, Q, R
		- where A , B and C are the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keep the object in static equilibrium, and α , β and γ are the angles directly opposite to the forces P, Q and R respectively.
		- ![[Pasted image 20240609213650.png]]
		- $\frac{P}{\sin \alpha}=\frac{Q}{\sin \beta }=\frac{R}{\sin \gamma}$
## Practice Problem
1. In the figure shown below, calculate the force (T) in cable BA and the force (R) in member BC if the resultant of the forces W (= 10 kips), F (= 5 kips) and T passes along BC

	- Sol
		- ![[Pasted image 20240609223921.png]]
		- $\theta=\tan^{-1}{\frac{3}{9}=18.43^0}$
		- $\sum F_{x}=5-T\cos 18.43-F_{BC}\cos 45=0$
		- $\sum F_{y}=T\sin18.43-F_{BC}\sin 45-10=0$
		- $T=11.86;F_{BC}=-8.84$
		- Also solve-able with lami

# MOMENT AND PARALLEL COPLANAR FORCES
## Moment/ Moment of a force about a point/ an axis
- Moment = Force X Moment arm ( perpendicular distance )
## Parallel Forces
- The forces, whose lines of action are parallel to each other, are call parallel forces
	- Like Parallel Forces
	- Unlike Parallel Forces
	![[Pasted image 20240610001231.png]]
- Couple 
	- A couple consists of two equal, unlike parallel forces acting out of line. The effect of a couple on a body is one of pure rotation
	- Couple Moment
		- Moment couple = Force X arm of couple

# NON-CONCURRENT, NON-PARALLEL COPLANAR FORCES 
## Two Force Member
- If a member is considered to be weightless, an assumption often made when the weight is inconsiderable as compared with the magnitude of the impressed forced, and there is only two forces acting on it, it is called two force member.  
- Any rigid body under the influence of force actions introduced at only two physical locations will undergo a motion until these (net) force actions comprise a collinear force system.  
- A structural member is a slender two force member if 
	- It has uniform cross section and is longer than it is wide. 
	- It is concerned only to pin joints or ball and socket joints at its end. 
	- It has negligible weight compared with the forces acting at its ends.
- Two types
	- Compression member
	- Tension member
- Truss only
## Three Force Member
- Any rigid body under the influence of force actions introduced at three physical locations will undergo a motion until these (net) force actions comprise a concurrent force system
## Truss
- Plane truss: 
	- all the truss members lie in same plane and load on the truss also lie in the same plane thus forming a 2-D (two dimensional) planar structure
- Space truss:
	- all the truss members and load on the truss are not lying in the same plane thus forming a 3-D (three dimensional) space structure
### Methods of Analysis of Plane Truss
1. Method of joints: 
	1. Determine the support reactions from equilibrium conditions as the in the case of beams. 
	2. Select joint with only two members. Formulate two equations of equilibrium so that only one unknown appears in each equation, if possible. 
	3. Select that the next joint such that only two unknown member forces exist, and solve them as in the previous step. 
	4. Repeat the previous steps till all the member forces are obtained
