# Mechanics
- ,Mechanics is the branch of science concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment.
- Based on the concepts: time, space, force, energy, matter. 
- The mechanics, which is developed as on today, may be grouped as below:
	- Classical (Newtonian) mechanics
	- (The mechanics based on Newton’s laws of motion) Relativistic mechanics
	- Quantum or wave mechanics
# Engineering Mechanics
- Engineering /Applied mechanics is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics. Applied mechanics examines the response of bodies (solids and fluids) or systems of bodies to external forces. 
- Some examples of mechanical systems include the flow of   a liquid under pressure, the fracture of a solid from an applied force, or the vibration of an ear in response to sound.
- Classification of Engineering Mechanics
	- Mechanics of Rigid Bodies
		- A body in which all the particles occupy the fixed position with respect to each other is called body of rigid body. However no body is rigid; everybody undergoes some deformation which acted by forces.

	- Mechanics of Deform-able Bodies
	- Mechanics of Fluids
- The mechanics of rigid bodies dealing with bodies with rest is termed as ‘Statics’ and that dealing with the bodies in motion is termed as ‘Dynamics’ The dynamics is further divided into two streams – Kinematics and kinetics.
	- ‘Kinematics’ is the branch of dynamics which deals with the motion of bodies without referring to the forces causing the motion of the body.
	- ‘Kinetics’ is the branch of dynamics which deals with the motion of bodies referring to the forces causing the motion

# Force
- Force may be defined as an agent which produces, destroy or tends to destroy motion.
- Definition of force: a force should be completely defined only when the following four characteristics are specified.
	- Magnitude
	- Line of action/location
	- Direction/sense
	- Point of application
- Types of forces:
	- Fundamental Forces:
		- Electromagnetic Force 
		- Gravitational Force 
		- Strong Nuclear Force 
		- Weak Nuclear Force
	- Non-fundamental forces (Acting on a body):
		- Push or Pull
		- Tension or Compression
		- Weight
		- Friction and Normal force
		- Shear Force
