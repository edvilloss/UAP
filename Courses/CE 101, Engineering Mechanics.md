# Mechanics
- ,Mechanics is the branch of science concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment.
- Based on the concepts: time, space, force, energy, matter. 
- The mechanics, which is developed as on today, may be grouped as below:
	- Classical (Newtonian) mechanics
	- (The mechanics based on Newton’s laws of motion) Relativistic mechanics
	- Quantum or wave mechanics
# Engineering Mechanics
- Engineering /Applied mechanics is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics. Applied mechanics examines the response of bodies (solids and fluids) or systems of bodies to external forces. 
- Some examples of mechanical systems include the flow of   a liquid under pressure, the fracture of a solid from an applied force, or the vibration of an ear in response to sound.
- Classification of Engineering Mechanics
	- Mechanics of Rigid Bodies
		- A body in which all the particles occupy the fixed position with respect to each other is called body of rigid body. However no body is rigid; everybody undergoes some deformation which acted by forces.

	- Mechanics of Deform-able Bodies
	- Mechanics of Fluids
- The mechanics of rigid bodies dealing with bodies with rest is termed as ‘Statics’ and that dealing with the bodies in motion is termed as ‘Dynamics’ The dynamics is further divided into two streams – Kinematics and kinetics.
	- ‘Kinematics’ is the branch of dynamics which deals with the motion of bodies without referring to the forces causing the motion of the body.
	- ‘Kinetics’ is the branch of dynamics which deals with the motion of bodies referring to the forces causing the motion

# Force
- Force may be defined as an agent which produces, destroy or tends to destroy motion.
- Definition of force: a force should be completely defined only when the following four characteristics are specified.
	- Magnitude
	- Line of action/location
	- Direction/sense
	- Point of application
- Types of forces:
	- Fundamental Forces:
		- Electromagnetic Force 
		- Gravitational Force 
		- Strong Nuclear Force 
		- Weak Nuclear Force
	- Non-fundamental forces (Acting on a body):
		- Push or Pull
		- Tension or Compression
		- Weight
		- Friction and Normal force
		- Shear Force

- Types of support conditions and their reactions and Deformations

# Resultant and Components Force
- Resultant and components Force
	- If a number of forces P1, P2, P3 ……. etc are acting simultaneously on a particle, then a single force, which will produce the same effect as that of all the given forces, is known as a resultant force. The forces P1, P2, P3 ……etc are called component forces.
## Parallelogram Law of Forces

# Co-planer concurrent forces
- If the forces in a system lie in a single plane and pass through a single point, then the system constitutes a coplanar concurrent force system
- Resultant
	- $R_{x}=\sum F_{x}$
	- $R_{y}=\sum F_{y}$
	- $R=\sqrt{ R_{x}^2 +R_{y}^2}$
	- $\tan \theta =\frac{\left( \sum F_{y} \right)}{\left( \sum F_{x} \right)}$
- Equilibrium Conditions
	- $R_{x}=0;R_{y}=0$
- Equilibrium of 3 forces
	- Triangle law of forces
		- If two forces acting simultaneously on a body are represented by the sides of a triangle taken in order, their resultant is represented by the closing side of the triangle taken in the opposite side

		- $P+Q=R$
	- Lami's Theorem
		- Lami's theorem is an equation relating the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keeps an object in static equilibrium, with the angles directly opposite to the corresponding forces. P, Q, R
		- where A , B and C are the magnitudes of three coplanar, concurrent and non-collinear forces, which keep the object in static equilibrium, and α , β and γ are the angles directly opposite to the forces P, Q and R respectively.

		- $\frac{P}{\sin \alpha}=\frac{Q}{\sin \beta }=\frac{R}{\sin \gamma}$
## Practice Problem
- In the figure shown below, calculate the force (T) in cable BA and the force (R) in member BC if the resultant of the forces W (= 10 kips), F (= 5 kips) and T passes along BC

	- $R_{F+W}=\sqrt{ 5^2+10^2 }=11.18$
	- $\theta_{FBW'}=\tan^{-1} (\frac{10}{5})=53.43^0$
	- $\alpha =\theta_{ABF}+\theta_{FBW'}=180-\tan^{-1}{\frac{3}{9}}+53.43 \\ =217.99^0$
	- $\beta =\theta_{FBW''}+\theta _{WBC}=90-53.43+\tan^{-1}{\frac{5}{5}} \\\ =81.57^0$
	- $\gamma=\theta_{ABC}=\tan^{-1}{\frac{3}{9}}+45=63.43$
	- $\frac{T_{AB}}{\beta}=\frac{T_{BC}}{\alpha}=\frac{T_{R}}{\gamma}$
	- $T_{AB}=\frac{11.18*81.57}{63.43}=$
