# Mechanics
- ,Mechanics is the branch of science concerned with the behavior of physical bodies when subjected to forces or displacements, and the subsequent effects of the bodies on their environment.
- Based on the concepts: time, space, force, energy, matter. 
- The mechanics, which is developed as on today, may be grouped as below:
	- Classical (Newtonian) mechanics
	- (The mechanics based on Newtonâ€™s laws of motion) Relativistic mechanics
	- Quantum or wave mechanics
# Engineering Mechanics
- Engineering /Applied mechanics is a branch of the physical sciences and the practical application of mechanics. Applied mechanics examines the response of bodies (solids and fluids) or systems of bodies to external forces. 
- Some examples of mechanical systems include the flow of   a liquid under pressure, the fracture of a solid from an applied force, or the vibration of an ear in response to sound.
- Classification of Engineering Mechanics
	- Mechanics of Rigid Bodies
		- A body in which all the particles occupy the fixed position with respect to each other is called body of rigid body. However no body is rigid; everybody undergoes some deformation which acted by forces.

	- Mechanics of Deform-able Bodies
	- Mechanics of Fluids
