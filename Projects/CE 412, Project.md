# Introduction
## General
Under this project a 6 storied residential building will be constructed located Sirajganj. It is a reinforced concrete (RC) frame structure. The floor slabs will be constructed as beam supported slab. The original topography of the site was probably generally level ground. Based on the soil test report the foundation has been designed as shallow foundation. An Architectural Design Drawing (Auto CAD soft copy), Sub-soil Investigation Report (PDF soft copy), Project Information Sheet (doc. file) slabs found to be adequate in consideration of thickness and reinforcement are provided. So, we need to be submitted ETABS File (Soft copy of edb file), Project report (Soft copy of doc file), Sample drawing (Soft copy of hand sketch). The analysis and design of this building has been conducted according to Bangladesh Nation Building Code (BNBC) 2017.

## Material Specifications
### Concrete
The following concrete grades f'c (28 days cylinder strength) are adopted in design
- Directional Type: Isotropic
- Weight per unit volume 0.15 kip/ft^3
- Modulus of Elasticity (brick chip) = 4$5000\sqrt(f'_c) = 2623928.353 psi = 377845.6828 kip/ft^2$
- Poison's ration 0.2
- Concrete compressive strength, fc' = 3400 psi = 489.6 kip/ft^2
### Rebar
The Following steel grades fy are adopted in design:
Material type: Rebar
- Weight per unit volume: $0.49 kip/ft^3$
- Modulus of Elasticity $4176000 kip/ft^2$
- Minimum Yield Strength, fy: $9024.48 kip/ft^2$
- Minimum Tensile Strength, fu: $11280.6 kip/ft^2$
- Expected Yield Strength, fye: $9926.93 kip/ft^2$
- Expected Tensile Strength, fue: 1$2408.66 kip/ft^2$
